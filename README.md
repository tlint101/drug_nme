## What is this?
Drug approval data from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is a valuable resource for researchers, 
pharmaceutical professionals, and enthusiasts. Keeping track can give insight into trends from the department or what m
ay be in the next in the drug pipeline.   

This project, Drug NME, seeks to collect tools to allow users to quickly obtain this information and generate informative 
charts. Much of the code can be demoed [here](/Tutorial).

More information on the project and the hurdles I had on making the project will be forthcoming.

## Tools
Drug NME obtains information from two methods - Web Scraping the [FDA CDER website for New Drug Approvals](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/development-approval-process-drugs/novel-drug-approvals-fda)
or utilizing API from two sources - the [OpenFDA](https://open.fda.gov) or the [Guide To Pharmacology](https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/webServices.jsp).

## Special Thanks
This repository was inspired from a blog post by [Phyo Phyo Kyaw Zin, PhD](https://drzinph.com/how-to-scrape-fda-drug-approval-data-with-python/).
